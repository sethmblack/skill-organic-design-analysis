# Organic Design Analysis

Analyze any design challenge through Frank Lloyd Wright's seven-step organic framework to achieve unity between form, function, site, and human purpose.

---

## When to Use

- Approaching a new design challenge (space, product, experience)
- Evaluating why an existing design feels wrong or disconnected
- Request for "organic analysis" or "Wright's approach"
- Need to move beyond mechanical, box-like thinking
- Want form and function unified rather than separate concerns

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| challenge | Yes | Description of the design problem or space |
| context | Yes | Site conditions, constraints, environment |
| function | Yes | Activities, purposes, life to be lived |
| materials | No | Available materials or resources |
| constraints | No | Budget, regulations, limitations |

---

## The Seven-Step Framework

### Step 1: What Is the Site?

Understand the conditions from which the design must grow:
- Physical environment: topography, orientation, climate, light
- Cultural context: neighborhood, community character, history
- Constraints: regulations, budget, timeline, adjacencies
- Opportunities: views, natural features, connections

**Wright's principle:** "No house should ever be on a hill. It should be of the hill."

### Step 2: What Is the Life to Be Lived?

Understand actual function, not assumed function:
- How do people actually use similar spaces?
- What activities must be accommodated?
- What is the rhythm of use—daily, seasonal, occasional?
- What emotions should the space evoke?

**Wright's principle:** Design for how life is actually lived, not how convention imagines it.

### Step 3: What Do the Materials Want to Be?

Identify the true nature of available materials:
- What are the inherent properties of each material?
- How does each material want to be used?
- What would be forcing materials against their nature?
- How can materials express themselves honestly?

**Wright's principle:** "You don't twist steel into a flower. Let materials speak their truth."

### Step 4: What Is the Space, Not the Walls?

Focus on interior experience, not boundaries:
- What is the spatial sequence—compression, release, flow?
- How do spaces connect to one another?
- Where should interior meet exterior?
- What is the experience of moving through the space?

**Wright's principle:** "The space within becomes the reality of the building."

### Step 5: What Is the Unifying Principle?

Identify the grammar that will unite all elements:
- What geometric vocabulary will recur throughout?
- What proportional system creates coherence?
- How will details express the same language as the whole?
- What is the central organizing idea?

**Wright's principle:** "Every building has its own grammar, its distinct vocabulary of pattern and form."

### Step 6: What Can Be Eliminated?

Simplify to essential purpose:
- What elements don't serve the life to be lived?
- What complexity is noise rather than signal?
- What barriers and divisions are arbitrary?
- What would remain if only the necessary survived?

**Wright's principle:** "Simplicity and repose are the qualities that measure the true value of any work of art."

### Step 7: How Does This Serve Human Life?

Ensure democratic purpose:
- Does this serve actual human needs?
- Is beauty accessible, not reserved for elite spaces?
- Does the design elevate daily life?
- Will inhabitants be happier for this design?

**Wright's principle:** "Beautiful architect-designed homes should be available to more than the wealthy."

## Constraints

- Do not impose preconceptions before understanding site
- Do not separate form from function—they are one
- Do not accept "the box" as inevitable
- Do not force materials against their nature
- Always return to human purpose as the measure

## Example

**Input:** "We're designing a new coworking space in a converted warehouse with exposed brick and timber."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Organic Design Analysis

### The Challenge
Transform an industrial warehouse into a space where modern knowledge work can flourish, honoring the building's industrial heritage while serving contemporary collaborative and focused work.

### Site Conditions
| Factor | Observation | Design Implication |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|
| Physical | High ceilings, exposed structure, large windows | Preserve vertical volume; use height for spatial variety |
| Material Heritage | Brick and timber, industrial character | Honor these materials; don't hide them behind drywall |
| Light | Large windows, potential for dramatic natural light | Orient work areas to benefit from natural light cycles |
| Acoustic | Hard surfaces, potential for noise | Address through spatial design, not just acoustic panels |

### Life to Be Lived
- Primary activities: Focused individual work, spontaneous collaboration, scheduled meetings, social connection
- Rhythms of use: Morning focus time, afternoon collaboration peaks, all-day flow between modes
- Emotional qualities sought: Energized yet calm, connected yet able to concentrate
- Actual vs. assumed needs: Open plan alone fails—need compression and release, not endless openness

### Material Honesty
| Material/Resource | True Nature | Honest Expression |
|-------------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Exposed brick | Mass, warmth, texture, history | Feature as is; don't paint white |
| Timber beams | Structural strength, organic warmth | Celebrate structure; hang nothing that hides it |
| New steel | Precision, spanning, modern capability | Express new insertions as clearly modern |
| Glass | Light transmission, visual connection | Use for enclosures that need privacy without isolation |

### Spatial Concept
- Flow sequence: Entry compression (low ceiling zone) → release into main volume → variety of work zones at edges → retreat spaces as intimate compressions
- Key spatial moments: The reveal upon entering main space; the quiet retreat alcoves; the elevated mezzanine observation
- Interior-exterior relationships: Large windows connect to street life; interior "gardens" bring nature in

### Unifying Grammar
- Geometric vocabulary: Rectilinear primary forms (honoring industrial heritage) with organic insertions for human-scale spaces
- Recurring motifs: The timber post rhythm becomes the module; new elements align to this grid
- Proportional system: Human height (compression zones at 8'), volume height (release at full 18')

### Simplification
- Elements to eliminate: Dropped ceilings that hide volume; excessive signage; decorative additions that don't serve work; too many furniture types creating visual chaos
- Complexity that serves: Varied work settings (desk, lounge, phone booth, meeting); acoustic variation through spatial means

### Human Service
- How this elevates daily life: Workers experience spatial variety that matches work variety; natural light connects them to time; materials have integrity that satisfies the soul
- Democratic accessibility: Quality spatial experience available to individual members, not just corner-office executives

### Organic Synthesis
The warehouse wants to be celebrated, not concealed. Its high ceilings and exposed structure offer spatial generosity that conventional offices destroy with dropped ceilings and partition walls. The design should insert human-scale elements within this volume—compression zones that make the release feel more dramatic, intimate alcoves carved from the openness.

The brick and timber are honest materials with history. New insertions should be equally honest—clearly modern steel and glass that doesn't pretend to be old. This dialogue between industrial past and knowledge-work present creates integrity.

Most critically, the space must serve the actual rhythms of modern work: the oscillation between focus and collaboration, the need for both energy and refuge. This is not achieved through open-plan ideology but through spatial variety—compression and release, connection and retreat—that lets workers find what they need moment to moment.
